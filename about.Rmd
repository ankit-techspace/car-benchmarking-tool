This is a benchmarking application to help us determine which car performs economically best based on car characteristics(horsepower, displacement, # of cylinders, Transmission) and trip info (such as cost of petrol/diesel and price). Based on this info, the table will show the best available option.

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available on the GitHub.
